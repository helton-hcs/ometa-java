**OMetaJava**
===================

**OMetaJava** is the implementation of **[OMeta]**, using Java as the host programming language. It intend to use the greatest features of Java 8 and up.

Don't you know what is OMeta? According to its authors:
>OMeta is a new object-oriented language for pattern matching. It is based on a variant of Parsing Expression Grammars (PEGs) which we have extended to handle arbitrary data types. OMeta's general-purpose pattern matching facilities provide a natural and convenient way for programmers to implement tokenizers, parsers, visitors, and tree transformers, all of which can be extended in interesting ways using familiar object-oriented mechanisms.
